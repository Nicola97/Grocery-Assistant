# esselunga-scrape

Simple scraping project for [Esselunga online shop](https://www.esselungaacasa.it/).

Scraped data includes product names, prices per unit and prices per kg/liter, and nutritional information.

The purpose is to help calculating price, nutritional value and convenience of meals and diets, for example knowing which are the cheapest products per gram of protein (€/grams of protein) or per calories (€/cal).

For now the .csv has been converted to .xlsx with Microsoft Excel, which adds some interesting functionalities, but the idea is to build a simple front-end tailored to the data in order to ease building of meals and diets.
